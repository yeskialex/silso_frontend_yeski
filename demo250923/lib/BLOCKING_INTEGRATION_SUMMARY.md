- **Real-time Updates**: Immediate content filtering after blocking
- **Loading States**: Proper loading, error, and empty states

## 🔄 **Data Flow**

### **Blocking Flow:**
1. User taps block button/menu
2. Confirmation dialog appears
3. `UserService.blockUser()` called
4. User added to Firestore `users/{userId}/blockedUsers/`
5. Cache cleared, UI refreshed
6. Success message with undo option

### **Content Filtering Flow:**
1. App requests posts/comments/communities
2. `BlockingIntegrationService` intercepts calls
3. Blocked user IDs fetched (with 5-minute caching)
4. Content filtered client-side
5. Filtered results returned to UI

### **Cache Management:**
- Blocked user IDs cached for 5 minutes
- Cache cleared on block/unblock actions
- Automatic refresh on app restart

## 🎯 **Integration Points**

### **Existing App Compatibility**
The integration maintains full compatibility with existing code:
- ✅ Uses existing `Post` and `Community` models
- ✅ Works with existing `CommunityService`
- ✅ Preserves all existing functionality
- ✅ No breaking changes to existing screens

### **Performance Optimizations**
- ✅ 5-minute caching for blocked user IDs
- ✅ Client-side filtering (no extra Firestore queries)
- ✅ Batch operations for multiple blocks
- ✅ Efficient memory usage

## 🚀 **Usage Examples**

### **For Users:**
1. **Block from Post**: Post Detail → Menu → Block User
2. **Block from Comment**: Comment → Menu → Block User  
3. **Block from Search**: Search Results → Menu → Block User
4. **Manage Blocks**: Settings → 차단된 계정 → View/Unblock

### **For Developers:**
```dart
// Use filtered data sources
final posts = await BlockingIntegrationService().getFilteredPosts();
final comments = await BlockingIntegrationService().getFilteredPostComments(postId);

// Add block functionality
BlockingUtils.showBlockUserDialog(
  context: context,
  userIdToBlock: userId,
  username: username,
  onBlocked: () => refreshContent(),
);
```

## ⚙️ **Configuration**

### **Firebase Setup**
- Firestore collections: `users/{userId}/blockedUsers/{blockedUserId}`
- Security rules configured for user privacy
- Real-time sync for immediate updates

### **App Settings**
- Cache duration: 5 minutes (configurable)
- UI refresh: Automatic after blocking actions
- Error handling: User-friendly messages

## 🧪 **Testing Recommendations**

### **Manual Testing Checklist:**
- [ ] Block user from post detail screen
- [ ] Block user from comment
- [ ] Block user from search results  
- [ ] Verify blocked content disappears immediately
- [ ] Check settings page shows blocked users
- [ ] Test unblock functionality
- [ ] Verify undo action works
- [ ] Test with anonymous posts/comments
- [ ] Verify cache performance

### **Edge Cases:**
- [ ] Blocking yourself (should be prevented)
- [ ] Blocking already blocked user
- [ ] Network errors during blocking
- [ ] Large numbers of blocked users
- [ ] Anonymous user interactions

## 📊 **Performance Metrics**

### **Expected Performance:**
- **Cache Hit Rate**: >90% for blocked user checks
- **UI Response Time**: <100ms for block actions
- **Memory Usage**: <5MB additional for blocking system
- **Firestore Reads**: Reduced by 80% through caching

### **Monitoring:**
```dart
// Get blocking statistics
final stats = await BlockingIntegrationService().getBlockingStats();
print('Blocked users: ${stats['totalBlockedUsers']}');
```

## 🛠️ **Maintenance & Updates**

### **Future Enhancements:**
- Temporary blocks (24-hour blocks)
- Block categories (posts only, comments only)
- Bulk blocking operations
- Admin override capabilities
- Reporting system integration

### **Code Maintenance:**
- Regular cache optimization review
- Monitor Firestore usage patterns
